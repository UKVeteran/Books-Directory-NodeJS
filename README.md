# Books-Directory-NodeJS

The most basic project you can create using Node.js and Express.js or Nest.js is a simple REST API.

For this purpose, I would like to build a book directory, where the endpoints are created using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, a n ew book is added to the list. The PUT method is usded for updating the existing book, and it is clear that the DELETE method will remove the book from the list.
